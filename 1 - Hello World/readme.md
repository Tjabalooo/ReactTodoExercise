# 1 - Hello World

In this step we will create a new react project using create-react-app and then clean out the things we don't need.

## Creating a project

Use a terminal of your choice and navigate to where ever you would like your new project to be created, and then run:

```bash
npx create-react-app todo-list
```
*(Using npx instead of npm runs the tool without intalling it.)*

When the installation is complete, navigate to the root of the project and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

You should now have the create-react-app initial template running on localhost:3000, which means that you have a working React project on your machine!

## Cleaning our project
